This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.


# My Notes

## Benefits
- supports both SSR & CSR
- faster loading & redendering
- performance optimizations
- SEO optimizations
- less dependencies

## Sever (SSR) vs Client (CSR) Side Rendering
  - Server: api, fetching, less js code on client side
      - It is by default
  - Client: 
      - state management & hooks, 
      - browser APIs & interactivity(click, mouseOver, etc), 
      - react classes
    ```js
    // to implement simply CSR
      "use client"
    ```

## creating new next app
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

- next step: pre-built configurations
```bash
√ What is your project named? ... share-prompts
√ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use Turbopack for next dev? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to customize the import alias (@/* by default)? ... No / Yes
√ What import alias would you like configured? ... @/*
```

## basic structure
```bash
app/
    fonts/
    globals.css
    layout.js
    page.js

node_modules/
public/
config files...
```
- `globals.css`: by default tailwind configs & global css
- `layout.js`: provides layout structure in the page

```jsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lan="en"> 
      <body> 
        <header />
        <main />
        <footer />  
        {children}  
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

  - inside `layout.js` we can also modify meta tags and more
    ```js
    export const metadata = {
      title: "Create Next App",
      description: "Generated by create next app",
    };
    ```

## Routing 
- for routing Next.js utilises folder structure
- it does not require `react-router-dom` (an additional dependency)
```
// localhost:3000/posts/new
// localhost:3000/posts/:postId
    // e.g. localhost:3000/posts/post-001, post-002, etc
app/
    posts/
        [postId]/  // dynamic routing
          page.js
        new/      // static routing
          page.js
        page.js
```

- we can also add `layout.js` in subfolders
- this allows the routings pages to share components
- this layout is specific for that particular subfolder
- we can also make a custom and other loading components for that subfolder

## Error handling
- convetion used is `error.js`.
- It will automatically be used by the next.js for that particular subfolder

- error must be client side to recognize error
```js
"use client"
```

we ma have useEffect to console the error
or a button to reset on click

## Data-fetching

1. SSR: Server Side Rendering 
2. SSG: Server Side Generation
3. ISR: Incremental Static Generation

### caching
- good for data which doesn't change frequently
  - e.g. blog post, docs, maketing pages, etc

- auto caching was before Next.js v15
- In v15 -> NO AUTO CACHING


### API Endpoints
- http methods next.js supports: get, fetch, put, patch, update, delete, head, options

- just create `route.js`
  - in app/ -> global routes
  - in subfolder like posts -> it might confuse between page routing and API routing
  - recommendation: api/users, api/posts format to choose according to use case

- No need to create extra server like express
- No CORS issues

- simplification of API routing

- simple get example
  ```js
  export async function GET(request) {

    return new Response('Raam Raam Next.js');
  }
  ```
- simple way to implement
  ```js
  export async function GET(request) {
    // handle GET reqs for api/users
    // retrieve users  from the database or any other data source

    const users = [
      { id: 1, name: "Rohan"},
      { id: 2, name: "Shiv"},
      { id: 3, name: "Kanha"}
    ];

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(users));
  }
  ```

- just think about and focus on Business Logic


## SEO & Metadata

We can define metadata in two ways: static and dynamic

1. Static Metadata
    ```js
    export const metadata = {
      title: "Raam Raam Bhai",
      description: "raam raam",
    };
    ```
1. Dynamic Metadata
    ```js
    export async function generateMetadata({ params, searchParams }) {
      const product = await getProduct(params.id);

      return {
        title: product.title
      };
    }
    ```
